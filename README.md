# Image Size Assistant

This Sketch Assistant checks the dimensions of the images in your document, to find opportunities to
reduce the file size.

Sketch imports the uncompressed originals of images you drop into your canvas. This can cause your
document to be larger than it needs to be, specially if you're not using the original image size.
